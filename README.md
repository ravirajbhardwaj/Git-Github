# üõ†Ô∏è Onboarding Documentation: Git and GitHub for ChaiCode Cohort

Welcome to the ChaiCode Cohort! This documentation is designed to introduce you to `Git` and `GitHub`, two essential tools for developers in our company. The purpose of this guide is to help you set up, understand, and use these tools effectively for seamless collaboration and code management. Together, we‚Äôll ensure smooth workflows and strong teamwork. üöÄ

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of Git and GitHub

### üßë‚Äçüíª What is `Git`?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that allows developers to:
- Track changes in their code.
- Collaborate with teammates.
- Maintain a complete history of the project.

It ensures every change is documented and reversible, making it indispensable for modern software development.

### ü§î Why is `Git Used`?

- **Version Control**: Maintain a history of changes.
- **Collaboration**: Work with multiple team members on the same project without overwriting changes.
- **Code Safety**: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

### üåê What is `GitHub`?

GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code:
- Centralized code repositories.
- Tools for code review, issue tracking, and continuous integration.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install Git
1. Visit [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Download the version suitable for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Follow the installation instructions.

### Step 2: Configure Git
After installation, configure your name and email (must match your Chai Cohort email):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
To verify your configuration:
```bash
git config --list
```

### Step 3: Set Up GitHub

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

### SSH Key Setup (For Secure Access)
Generate an SSH key (if not already done):
       Follow prompts and save the key.
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email.com"
```

Copy the public key to GitHub:
      Go to GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > Add SSH Key and paste it.
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```
Authenticate GitHub via SSH
Test the SSH connection:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cloning the Repository
Copy the SSH/HTTPS URL and run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ravirajbhardwaj/Git-Github.git

cd Git-Github
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Commit Message Rules

### Why Good Commit Messages Matter?

- They provide a clear history of changes.
- Suggested Commit Message Guidelines:
  ![Commit History](./commits.png "a title")
- Help teammates understand the purpose of changes.
  ![Commit History](./purpose.png "a title")
- Facilitate debugging and collaboration.

#### `Structure: <type>(<scope>): <description>`
Types: Use clear prefixes such as:
- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Code style or formatting changes.
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality.

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add user login functionality

fix(api): resolve timeout issue in fetch requests
```

--- 

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices

- **Pull Requests (PRs)**
  - Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix.
  - Provide a detailed description of changes.
  - Assign reviewers and address feedback promptly.

- **Branching Workflow**
1. `Main Branch`: Always deployable and stable.
2.  `Feature Branches`: Develop new features or fixes (e.g., feature/login).
3. `Merge Strategy`: Merge feature branches into main via PRs.

### General Tips

- Commit often and meaningfully.
Regularly pull updates to stay in sync.
- Resolve conflicts as soon as they arise.
