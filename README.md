## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of Git and GitHub

### üßë‚Äçüíª What is `Git`?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that allows developers to:
- Track changes in their code.
- Collaborate with teammates.
- Maintain a complete history of the project.

It ensures every change is documented and reversible, making it indispensable for modern software development.

### ü§î Why is `Git Used`?

- **Version Control**: Maintain a history of changes.
- **Collaboration**: Work with multiple team members on the same project without overwriting changes.
- **Code Safety**: Experiment with new features without affecting the main codebase.

### üåê What is `GitHub`?

GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** built on Git, designed to enhance team collaboration. It provides:
- Centralized code repositories.
- Tools for code review, issue tracking, and continuous integration.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Commit Message Rules

### Why Good Commit Messages Matter?

- They provide a clear history of changes.
- Help teammates understand the purpose of changes.
- Facilitate debugging and collaboration.
- Suggested Commit Message Guidelines:


#### `Structure: <type>(<scope>): <description>`
Types: Use clear prefixes such as:
- `feat`: A new feature.
- `fix`: A bug fix.
- `docs`: Documentation changes.
- `style`: Code style or formatting changes.
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality.

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add user login functionality

fix(api): resolve timeout issue in fetch requests
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Best Practices

- **Pull Requests (PRs)**
  - Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix.
  - Provide a detailed description of changes.
  - Assign reviewers and address feedback promptly.

- **Branching Workflow**
1. `Main Branch`: Always deployable and stable.
2.  `Feature Branches`: Develop new features or fixes (e.g., feature/login).
3. `Merge Strategy`: Merge feature branches into main via PRs.

### General Tips

- Commit often and meaningfully.
Regularly pull updates to stay in sync.
- Resolve conflicts as soon as they arise.
